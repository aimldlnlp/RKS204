# Line Following Robot ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¡

**Course:** RKS204: Robotics Experiment 1

This project implements a line-following robot using multiple IR sensors for detecting the path and intersections. The robot is controlled by two motors, enabling it to move along a predefined line, adjusting its direction based on real-time sensor feedback. The robot can also handle intersections, making decisions to move left or right when encountering them.
